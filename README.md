# vuejs-select-cascate-with-component

I had to create something dynamic to render select cascading, so I created this little example to describe my idea.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
